                            <p>Session musicians typically do not play out shows with clients because they are very busy musicians and are often booked out weeks in advance with their own bands. However, if they're available (and for a fee) it is possible they could play a show for any client. Assumed it would not be a regular occurrence.

                            <p>Music producers are often defined as the unsung heroes behind the scenes in popular music. 
                                In the beginning of the music industry, a producer was a bank representative to assure that the budget was actually allocated properly and the music was going to "hit the spot" so that it would eventually sell to the masses. 
                                In the music industry today, the music producer serves much the same role as a director in a film. It is the music producer’s job to make sure that in the end the finished product is as good as it can be. 
                                In some cases this may simply involve making it listenable, however in other cases this means making sure the song is a hit, or at least has the potential to be a hit. 
                                Their job is essentially to make sure that a song is well-recorded and well- produced. Producers are also the overall coordinator to help orchestrate all of the resources to get the final product!

                                get their parts right to making sure the microphones the right distance from a guitar amplifier to guiding the session in the appropriate direction. Good music producers understand every aspect of studio production. They also have a very good ear and a well-rounded knowledge of how voices and instruments produce recordable sound. A producer will get inside your head to figure out what you're aiming for and he will actualize your musical goal. Whether it be the performance, pitch, tone of each instrument, emotion of the song and typically today that would mean that a producer has extensive knowledge on equipment, music theory, pulls the reigns of the session musicians and possess the people skills to push and squeeze every
                                ounce of greatness out of each performer and production personnel.

                            <p>Today, producers are more likely to multi-task. They are good engineers as they mostly started as an engineer. And they're very good editors. Part of getting a great performance is editing what wasn't or cannot be played in the session itself. Sometimes editing is the only way to bring out a certain sound in a performance. You'll often find that a good producer with good engineering skills prefers to be completely in control to guarantee the best results. A music producer's job is essentially to make sure that a song is well recorded and well
                                produced.

A few examples: for pop, the artist and producer come together and discuss what the artist is looking to create and the influence they're looking to base the song after and the producer either begins to compose during the meeting or does so at a different time, sends the files to the artist for tweaks or revisions, and then prepares the track for vocals. For bands, the band and the producer either work on songwriting in a practice space or during a
                                recording session.

                            <p>Mixing is the process which commences after all tracks are recorded and edited as individual parts. 
                                Mixing can consist of various processes where the mix engineer takes the raw recorded tracks (or a rough mix from producers) and sets levels, EQ's, uses compression, uses stereo panning, and the addition of effects. 
                                In a way, mixing is like taking the raw ingredients and blending it together as if it is a presentable meal. You can learn more about mixing by going to our <a href="mixing.html">Mixing</a> & <a href="mastering.html">Mastering</a> page.</a>

                            <p>You need your recording mixed because mixing will absolutely do your songs justice. When we record your music, we are focusing on the performance and the capturing of it. But mixing puts attention on making it sound and feel better, and post-production is the only time we get to do that. Even if it is recorded perfectly, not every instrument or voice will fit right together so as absolutely necessary step to
                                finalize your track. In fact, all commercially released music that you hear on the radio or on television has been mixed, so if you want commercially professional music, you have to have it mixed. At Mix Room Studios Nepal, we built dedicated rooms for mixing which provides the perfect workflow for our mix engineers to speed up the
                                process and maximize the quality.

                                During the mixing process, the mix engineers reveal every detail of each song, bring it up to the surface and expose it all where they are EQing, compressing, and enhancing the overall sound. 
                                Highly educated on the anatomy of all sounds recorded individually and combined, are appropriately described "the MacGyver's of the Studio" where they are highly competent impressively aware so that nothing gets by them.

                            <p>Anyone from passionate beginners to experienced audio engineers and producers can absolutely be in any of our programs. If you’ve been writing songs or producing beats or recording music for years and you want to improve your technique, enhance your abilities, record professionally or you've at least pressed record in a recording program before, then you’re ready to start.
                                We have had many collegiate students majoring in Recording Arts take advantage of our programs to supplement their education and boost their confidence in the field. You will be exposed to very high level techniques and skills. If you’ve got the passion for it, you’re all set.

                            <p>Pricing ranges starts from Rs. 30,000 and goes unto Rs. 200,000 but it actually depends upon your courses and any extra course you want to add-on. 
                                While this may see daunting to some, these prices are quite reasonable compared to other programs, colleges and international universities that normally charge Rs 400,000- Rs 70,00,000+ for tuition.
                                 We do not have any pre-requisite classes nor any additional fees (ie. Admission Fees, Registration Fees, Student Fees, Technology Fee, Books & Supplies, Housing, etc) so we can keep our tuition very low.

                            <p>We have developed these courses for aspiring producers and engineers to succeed in one of the toughest industries. Our programs give you the best foundation of knowledge and experience so you can grasp the professional skills needed to make create, record and
                                enhance high-quality music.
                                Your level of professionalism all depends on your prior experience level, how much you decide to get out of the course, as well as what you do with the knowledge afterward in your own studio to develop these skills. After completing the course, you can still count on the
                                instructors to give you further real world advice and guidance.

                            <p>Yes! That is the main purpose of our courses. Being a good engineer or producer is much more than just knowing the tools or studying manuals. You will learn the key concepts the pros use—and most importantly you will be shown how it all works inside a real studio, so you can then apply this in your own home studio with better quality results as your experience and skill develops.

                            <p>Our courses are not state-certified, but students who finish their course in its entirety will get a certificate signifying they’ve done training inside a professional studio. Like many other creative industries, the music business does not run on degrees. The studio owners, music executives, and producers who are hiring generally do not ask for degrees. In fact, when seeking out in-house engineers and producers, we care most about their products! What do their recordings sound like? What do their mixes sound like? What do their productions sound like? Having experience, people-skills and connections also matters because they’re markers of someone who is
                                trustworthy, hardworking, and dependable

If you are a current Recording Arts Major, like some of our students, our programs can greatly supplement your education by providing actual hands-on experience and boost your confidence in the field.

                            <p>Yes, in fact, over the past few years, Mix Room Studios Nepal has taken on a few of our most dedicated graduates as interns. Some have even worked their way up to paid freelance engineers! They showed up, put
                                in hours of work, and showed us they had what it takes.</p>
                                <p>
                                Our programs give you a big advantage when it comes to entry-level positions in any level of music studio. Truth is, people-skills, ability and real studio experience are at the top of a recording studios’ want list
                                when searching for helping hands. Studios want to know that you can be valuable INSIDE a studio – without them having to teach you everything. Interns without real studio experience will clean, make coffee, and rarely (if ever) get to help on sessions before they are turned out the revolving door. This industry is over-saturated with engineers and producers trying to “make it”, because, unfortunately, a degree does not mean real studio experience. That harsh fact facing so many engineers is what we’re trying to help, by giving you a big
                                advantage with this training.
                                <p>
                                Unless you’ve learned and trained inside a real, working studio, how do you have the real studio experience studios are searching for? From our knowledge, and in all honesty, an internship won’t give you that either–not if you’re stuck cleaning and answering phones. Don’t take that risk. Get real studio experience! Then apply at a studio where your passion and value will have a much better chance at being
                                recognized and put to use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s a sad waste to have the passion for audio but not know how to use it effectively inside a studio. Or worse, thinking you have what it takes, and being turned away so many times that you lose confidence in yourself. Yes, having the passion and a great attitude is important, but real studio experience is not only in demand, it will help you build an unshakable foundation for your career. The combination can boost you up in one of the most rewarding yet toughest industries to break
                                into. Don’t let it break you first!
